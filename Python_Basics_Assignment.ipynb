        "#Python Basics\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1- What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "Ans - Python is an open-source programming language that is free to use and distribute.Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.  \n",
        "Phython is Popular because:Python is easy to learn, Python has an active, supportive community, Python is flexible,Python offers versatile web-development solutions , Python is well suited to data science and analytics, Python is efficient, fast, and reliable7. Python is widely used with IoT Technology\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2- What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "Ans - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions and then running them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3- What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Ans - Predefined keywords are reserved words with special meanings so the interpreter can understand them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4- Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "Ans- No\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5- What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after it's created.\n",
        "eg - lists and dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6- Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "Ans- Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7- What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "Ans- The '==' is known as the equality operator.In Python, == checks for value equality (whether two objects have the same value), while is checks for object identity (whether two variables point to the same object in memory).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "a = 5\n",
        "b = 5\n",
        "c = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "d = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(a == b)  # True (values are equal)\n",
        "print(a is b)  # True (both variables point to the same object, in this case a small integer)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(c == d)  # True (values are equal)\n",
        "print(c is d)  # False (variables point to different objects in memory)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8- What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Python logical operators are used to combine conditional statements, allowingto perform operations based on multiple conditions. These Python operators, alongside arithmetic operators, are special symbols used to carry out computations on values and variables.\n",
        "Eg: AND, OR, NOT\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9- What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Ans- In Python, type casting (also known as type conversion) is the process of converting a variable's data type to another, either implicitly (automatically by Python) or explicitly (using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10- What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "Ans- Implicit type casting is automatic, while explicit type casting is done by the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11- What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow your code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false,\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12- How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "Ans- The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13- what is the difference between for loop and while loops?\n",
        "Ans- A for loop in Python repeats executing a code block from a sequence till certain number of times. Whereas a while loop in Python repeats execution of a code block till the condition is true which is not certain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14- Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "Ans- A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you need to repeat an action until a certain condition is met, but you don't know in advance how many times the loop will run. This contrasts with a for loop, which is better suited for situations where the number of iterations is known beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Asking for a valid number\n",
        "# Repeatedly ask the user for input until they enter a valid number\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Please enter a number: \")\n",
